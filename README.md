# Nit


## Purpose

Nit is a framework for investigating Git-like storage systems. It aims to abstract the basic operations of such a system using a component model.


### Plumbing

In Git, fundamental operations are implemented with low-level subcommands collectively referred to as "plumbling" (as opposed to porcelain, the high-level commands that most users need to use).

Examples of plumbing commands:

1. ls-files
1. cat-file
1. hash-object
1.
